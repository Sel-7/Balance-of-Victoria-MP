#The game reads government definition files in alphabetical (or numerical) order by filename, and it reads individual
#files from beginning to end. When two different government types apply equally to a country, the game DOES NOT NECESSARILY
#GO WITH THE MORE SPECIFIC GOVERNMENT TYPE, but instead with which government type it comes to FIRST. If you want to give
#a country a bespoke government type (chartered company, Russian tsardom) you must make sure the game reads that government
#type BEFORE IT READS THE COUNTRY'S GENERIC GOVERNMENT TYPE (presidential dictatorship, absolute monarchy, etc.).
